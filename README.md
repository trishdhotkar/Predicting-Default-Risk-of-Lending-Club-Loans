# Predicting-Default-Risk-of-Lending-Club-Loans
Our main objective for this project is to implement some of the classification algorithms in order to build models to classify a good or bad loan with help of selected variables.


Dataset:
The dataset includes detailed information for every loan issued by Lending Club for year 2015.
The dataset from Lending Club contains 74 features that will be employed to train our model for
prediction. Not all of the fields are intuitively useful for our learning models, such as the loan ID and
the month the last payment was received, and thus we removed such fields.
We also removed fields for which greater than 80% of the values were missing.
Number of Features: 74 Number of records: 403697

Questions:
1) Which features contributes the most?

Feature Selection :
1) Lasso Regression 2) Principle Component Analysis 3) Recursive Feature Elimination 4) Random
Forest for Feature Ranking
Models :
1) Random Forest 2) Logistic Regression 3) Support Vector Machine 4) K Nearest Neighbors(KNN) 5)Decision Tree
